                        <p className='text-gray-900 text-lg text-justify'>Kitchen chimneys have become an essential part of modern homes and commercial kitchens, helping maintain a clean, smoke-free, and odor-free cooking space. But like any appliance, chimneys can run into problems over time that affect their performance and your kitchen’s air quality. From blocked filters and reduced suction to unusual noises, oil leaks, or complete motor failure these issues, if ignored, can make your chimney less effective and your kitchen more uncomfortable.
                        </p>

                        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-lg mt-4 text-justify text-gray-900">
                            <li><b>Chimney Installation : </b>We ensure a seamless chimney installation with accurate wall mounting, proper venting, secure electrical setup, and leak-free connections, optimizing airflow and smoke extraction for efficient kitchen ventilation from day one.</li>

                            <li><b>Weak or No Suction : </b>If your chimney isn't pulling smoke or heat properly, it can make your kitchen feel stuffy and uncomfortable. We inspect the duct system, clean internal parts, and ensure the motor and fan are working at full capacity to restore proper suction and airflow.</li>

                            <li><b>Unusual Noise or Vibration :  </b>Any strange sounds like humming, rattling, or grinding? This could indicate loose parts, a damaged motor, or imbalanced fans. Our technicians thoroughly check all components, ensuring quiet and smooth operation once we’re done.</li>

                            <li><b>Oil & Grease Build-Up : </b>Over time, oil and grease accumulate inside the chimney, clogging filters and ducts. This reduces the chimney’s efficiency and can lead to unpleasant smells or even fire hazards. We offer thorough deep-cleaning services, removing all grease and restoring your chimney’s performance.</li>

                            <li><b>Chimney Not Turning On : </b>If your chimney refuses to start, it could be due to electrical issues or a faulty switch. Our experts perform a full diagnostic check to identify whether it's a wiring issue, a motor failure, or something else, and provide an effective solution to get it working again.</li>

                            <li><b>Low Airflow During High Heat Cooking : </b>When cooking at high temperatures (grilling, frying, etc.), your chimney should be able to handle increased smoke and heat. If it can’t, it’s time for a service. We upgrade your chimney’s components, ensuring it operates at peak capacity even during intense cooking sessions.</li>

                        <p className='pl-5 text-lg mt-4 text-justify text-gray-900'>Maintaining your kitchen chimney in top condition ensures a clean, smoke-free cooking environment and long-lasting performance. Regular servicing, timely filter replacements, and early detection of issues like weak suction or unusual noise can prevent major malfunctions. While basic tasks like cleaning the filters or checking for grease buildup can be done at home, it’s best to call a certified technician for motor issues, electrical faults, or duct blockages. This way, you avoid further damage and ensure your chimney keeps your kitchen fresh and smoke-free for years to come.</p>
